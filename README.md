Here's the steps to run this react app:

1. clone my repo onto local directory (there should be a button somewhere, maybe to the top right?)
2. go to command prompt or terminal, navigate to the directory with my repo using cd Desktop, cd expense-tracker-beatdapp-master
  2.5 note that the repo name might be different for you.
3. type in 'npm start' in command line

3.5 if that doesn't work, try 'npm install' before 'npm start'
